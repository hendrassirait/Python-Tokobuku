Create using Tkinter

I'm using Tkinter to create frontend (the form) and then create backend file to manage database.
I'm using sqlite as my database, if there is no "buku.db",it should be automatically create it as you run the program at the first time.

I'm using pyinstaller to create app file on mac(I'm using mac)
the executable file is in dist folder, you need to run both files (terminal and app file) to run the app
if you using windows feel free to get my code (frontend.py and backend.py) and create exe file using pyinstaller in your windows.

thanks
